RTDevSys::Cmd::Command::run

=head1 EARLY VERSION WARNING

This is a very early version of RTDevSys. It is ready for use, and in fact is
being used. However there may be some API changes in the future. As well there
may be some missing, incomplete, or untested features. At the moment the
database commands only support postgres not mysql.
